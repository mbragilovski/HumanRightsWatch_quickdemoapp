POLICE 

So apparently it is 'all-clear' to allow a person to be killed because their domestic partner is infected with shit knows what but is seemingly within their Canadian 
civil rights not to disclose the information, not even a call from their doctor, making the doctor negligible at the least and complacent in inflicting bodily harm 
at the worst. Well, that seems to be the case as I am told by the Canadian police officer at division #4 in Concord ON (Rutherford and Mellville). Interesting. 
So it's OKAY to prioritize the lives of some residents to the disadvantage of one human being, an ex-immigrant from a 3rd world country in my case, collateral damage, 
deemed expendable, stigmatized, which is in direct violation of the International Bill of Human Rights, which, of course, conflicts with the national security 
interests, and thereby with objectives of any given police department. And so I was sacrificed for 16 years to the altar of NATIONAL interests. Splendid!

So when mighty glorious Police, on or off publicly funded payroll, is "chatting" so to speak with the audience seeking services of safety and protection 
(whoever they may be) - are the chats (i.e. Bell/Rogers switch operations, not subject to public disclosures, non-prof operated "tips", not subject to public 
disclosures) being transcribed, combined, analyzed and reported on performance-, success factors- and efficiency/effectiveness wise for posterity and any future 
reference if the need arises? Four (4) of us came in today to PD #4 (Rutherford and Mellville in Concord, ON) and none were taken reports from. We cannot rely on 
one person's judgment when people's lives are at stake even if it does not seem so at first and to the officer attending to any given matter, who like any human is
quite understandably subject to biases and prejudices. Even worse, are you allowing for harm to propagate and continue to be inflicted so that you gain more 
information for your decision making, redirect elsewhere (clean your plate, or improve the metrics) or while you are "investigating" thereby keeping us the 
unwilling hostages of the situation, wasting lives away and ridding folks of choices? Is that it, is that where I find myself the fuck up in the northern hemisphere 
on the continent of North America? what the fuck (!) pardon my french.


FINANCIAL CONSUMER AGENCY OF CANADA (FCAC)

So I have complained about unfair and deceptive business - re: Queen's University to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and received a redirect in response to 
my complaint to the Ministry of Colleges and Universities effectively removing the inconvenient complaint off FCAC's plate so that I brow-beat with the very 
organization, practices, and business of which I question. Dear Oversight Authority (or whatever it is you call yourself), which is supposed to institute policies 
and coordinate operations of educational organizations and their liaisons with industry and their overall effectiveness and benefit to the economy and job creation, 
unless, of course, I was in it for a different purpose. How is that supposed to work in your mind? Or is it done to "tire me out" and drain me of financial means to 
continue?

For the 100th time - have you heard of a notion called "Conflict of Interest", which is the precise situation you are putting me into again - I allege I've been 
defrauded with no work prospects in the field still to date and I am supposed to come up to the Ministry and say - hey Ministry - you fucked up, I know of your 
machinations and please give a nice and legit job now so that I can support myself because I put trust and goodwill into the process of higher education yet the 
industry with which you are supposed to coordinate doesn't seem to have a job for me. How do you think this conversation will go while I'm alienated from the outside 
world and with no financial means to pursue the manner seriously and thoroughly? Ummm, okay. let me throw a pebble into the sea. 
 
BANKS 

Bank of Modern Scotia (branch at 9333 Weston Rd. Unit #1), a special kind of finesse, voila ourdeurs, Monsieurs)

Okay, I am being clearly defrauded here. 

Investments - nonsense, bullshit of the highest caliber. I ask for disclosure of 100% investments in the fund, i.e. a breakdown of all companies the fund invests in 
so that I can trace returns of each, allowing for the stated MER, to the market value of the fund reported to me by my beloved Bank. One piece of information on the 
funds does not correspond to the other whatsoever, all are managed by the tight-knit partnership of Bank of Modern Scotia and 1832 Asset Management LLP.  I ask for 
one thing and am being given another. 'The fund may invest up to 49% investment in foreign equity'? Your math does not work. The fact sheet clearly states 62.3% of 
the Fund is in Canadian Equity, 3.9% - in Cash which adds up to 66.2% of clearly non-foreign equity. We only have 33.8% to go, not 49%. Why am I being sent a 331-page 
thick prospectus when I clearly ask for a breakdown of investments because the dividend pay on the 40% (the top 10 investments) exceeds the meager, close to 
non-existent, return (~0.5%) you are showing and were altogether not there 2 months ago when I miraculously lost 16.7% of my investment value (market) while the 
market was showing ~4+% growth. Ummmm... what's happening with my financial assets? Do you expect me to go fist-fight to the local bank branch with the very people 
who are managing my assets, and then be cut off the road for being such a nuisance? How convenient, especially if some of the PD folks are related to some of the 
Bank's folk and/or are friends and/or are going for drinks together to discuss the next plausible target to attack and defraud. 
Mortgage - spoofing of federal websites (through Bell box China-export technology switch operator or other tools planted with neighbors, etc.) is not cool and isn't 
very believable either.  Defrauding me like that (inflation throughout, mortgage rates hike monthly and on a clock but my investment savings are somehow severely 
underperforming) with fake monthly hikes of interest rate is not a gesture of love and respect either, especially when the police is in on the deal. 

I want to know and I have the right to know why you are intentionally forcing me out of my house. I'm waiting for an explanation of what's going on with my status 
and why I am being subjected to all these nonsense phenomena and being denied a living, and other federal services aside from RCMP wing of destruction and devastation.

This is how all vulnerable, stigmatized and thus socially isolated folk can be easily taken advantage of in Canada, especially if you are an immigrant from 3rd world 
countries and thereby are socio-economically marginalized. I choose to live in a given community, why is that I am being forcefully (by financial means) plucked out 
of here? 

What now - are you forcing me to go out and start surveys of who gets what rate and performance of their investments, what am I, a survey monkey app? I tried that 
already with one of the blond white privileged Canadian females who snubbed me right away, just like the many doctors and various services available to citizens of 
Ontario, Canada. We are clearly in different socio-economic and cultural profiles. She moved on for title and money, well, I must have been pursuing business 
opportunities for some other clandestine purpose or on a  frenzy to find a hot lover, she must have thought. 

I don't see a reason why I have to "chat around" like that in the first place. Why is it that I am being mistreated so severely that I have to think about being 
enslaved and set up time and time again? I can see the standard of life of everyone else in general and compare it to that of mine, I don't need to do any 
surveys and chats, I want fair and legal treatment of my person by definition and apriori.  

Canada, you are undermining and acting against my human rights. 

Please adjust my investment market values and mortgage interest rate to that of a 37-year-old highly educated and capable Canadian native from a good family and 
all, because the circumstances you put me in were not of my own choosing and under your control.  Compensate me for my losses as my mortgage payments went up 261% 
over a 2-year period. This is extortion and with no added value, quite the opposite actually.
