Canadian grocery shopping experience of a displaced person, disinherited, exiled, impoverished, stripped of its land and heritage ... in other words - a man-made 
Gold Digger and a whore. 

Let's call it what it is. Folks here think my grocery shopping is akin to engaging in sexual activity. You are right, I go to Longo's for sex and to be duped and 
defrauded while at it on a weekly basis. I thoroughly enjoy the constant presence of ducks and fraud, too.

Today I fell in "love" with a grocery handler - a tall, lean, blonde, Arian-looking, twenty-something young man, who, I am certain, is of a well-to-do family 
(what is considered average or maybe an upper class), is well-educated and, hence, can afford to be just a grocery handler and date all the all-Canadian white pretty 
blonde girls, concentrate on himself and do whatever it is he likes. Then, he can successfully take over from daddy and/or mommy and be well off for the remainder of his 
life. This sort of fellow is usually strategically placed into menial jobs, they all, of course, live in condos and small apartments (naturally). Their watchful 
protecting mothers and fathers, who are thoroughly connected, especially in medical, legal, and financial arenas, and are successfully employed or run their businesses, 
fiercely fend off all the so-called 'Gold diggers' from foreign countries or of lower classes by going as far as matching them off to their equal "matches" - re: 
Kim Murphy - Chris Walker - JJ as one example and in my case the "equal" matches were all sorts of Indians and Middle Eastern men or slutting around drunken dogs eager 
for smaller booties and easy handles from Eastern Europe. That's right I have venom from missing out completely in my teens and on being a popular girl able to get any 
man she wants and enjoy her twenties and love affairs, butterflies, and walks under the moonlight. Instead, I worked 14 hours a day and was nursing 3 sick dudes because, 
let's face it, I'm too poor, too sick, too fat, and too foreign. I was just brought here to be a cleaning lady and a nurse, yes, I am that ugly. You didn't need to 
summon me to "teach" at "UofT", or parade me through your fucking shithole workplaces to prove that good-looking men don't usually "favor" me (like it's all on their 
faces, spare me) or that I won't do good in a predominantly Eastern and racially divergent from me workplaces.  I don't need these "experiences" anymore, and dudes' 
sour faces in my life already. I had more than enough. It is what it is - I have been stripped of my rights as a human being for a long time now, including the right to 
life (I don't have any), the right to normal healthcare, the right to establish a family, the right to fulfilling work and quality of life and the right to social 
engagement (I'm effectively disenfranchised from Canadian society).  

The KM-CW-JJ gang has vandalized my property through a series of contractors who sabotaged my front door railing, installed my locks, and vandalized my basement ceiling 
operating through Reliance (!).  

Yesterday and after checking out at the cashier's register I noticed an error on my grocery bill and tried to correct it by returning the erroneously-scanned merchandise 
whereupon I was greeted by an LGBTQ-friendly associate who gave me a $20 gift card for the troubles, I am not sure really why would a grocery store give out gift cards 
like that and masquerade as a grocery store but run an altogether different type of business. And now everyone is curious if I'll watch a money-related film on Netflix
or something else - i.e. what is it in my head - money or something else? The matching service and police are hard at work. Money is always on my mind, amongst other 
things.  Thank you Canada, read my other posts. 

The very practice of "hiding" the "golden" offspring is abominable. They probably think they are Easter eggs to be treasure-hunted or something. Everyone can see them,
they are glowing and shining in all possible ways, and everyone is very much aware of their status and privileges, yet the tradition of "hiding" the health/wealth/
prosperity passed over for generations naturally needs to be upheld. Guys/gals like that should all work as senior engineering associates, strictly remotely out of 
their "condos" (a work-from-home type of arrangement), oversee and nurture all the immigrants their parents lure into the country and then inconspicuously rob of their 
livelihoods. 

Their parents and extended family are so well connected that they can get the entire profile of any person in a matter of days. When my mother was diagnosed with 
immunocompromised inflammation in her brain stemming from an STD or some other unpalatable illness, I was quickly forced out, first, to the work-from-home type of 
arrangement and then into unemployment. This treatment of people, who immigrate out of necessity, or with their parents, who are being made very much aware of their 
socio-cultural value, or lack thereof, in the destination country, who give up their lives to make a living and either get cold showers or back-handed masquerade in 
return, who supports your entire egalitarian society, is commonplace in Canada.

Now, since I am already damaged psychologically and physically and my health has been affected in the worst ways possible - I hardly need your back-hand compliments 
and the matching service. What I need is a fulfilling job to support myself and enjoy the quality of life I envision for myself since all my other dreams are already 
over the horizon to be chased. I want everyone to fuck off already.
